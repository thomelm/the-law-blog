        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This spicy low-calorie soup contains plenty of flavor and fiber to keep you full and satisfied.
             Though fiber is well-known for its gut health benefits, it also plays a role in weight loss. 
             Research shows that people who simply eat 30 grams of fiber each day without making any other 
             significant changes to their diets lost just as much weight as those who follow more 
             complicated weight-loss diets. This low-cal soup packs in nearly 9 grams of fiber per serving 
             plus brings the metabolism-boosting heat from spicy chile peppers.</p>

            <li>4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or chicken broth</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans low-sodium pinto or black beans, rinsed</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large soup pot (8-quart or larger) over medium 
                heat. Add onions, carrot, celery, poblano (or bell pepper) and 
                garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 10 to 12 
                minutes. Add cabbage; cook, stirring occasionally until 
                slightly softened, about 10 minutes more. Add tomato paste, 
                chipotle, cumin and coriander; cook, stirring, for 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Add broth, water, beans and salt. Cover and bring to a boil 
                over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, 
                until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from 
                heat and stir in cilantro and lime juice. Serve garnished 
                with cheese, yogurt and/or avocado, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
