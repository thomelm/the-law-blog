    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Although the Japanese enjoy eating ramen at ramen shops, it is common for Japanese
        moms to make ramen at home. Making good ramen soup from scratch requires a lot of time
        and effort, so most households use packaged ramen which includes 2-3 servings of fresh
        noodles and a concentrated soup base.</p>
    <p>In this recipe, instead of spending many hours making the ramen soup base, I’ll show
        you how to make a delicious ramen soup that takes just 15 minutes. Best of all, it
        tastes much better than the soup base that comes with the package.</p>
    <p>In case you’re wondering, the soup for miso ramen is not the “miso soup” made from
        dashi and miso paste.</p>
    <p>Below, I explain the ingredients for Miso Ramen soup. I do not recommend skipping or
        substituting the following ingredients because each ingredient plays an important role.
        As a result, you get a rich and intensely savory bowl of miso ramen that will greatly
        satisfy your cravings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 knob of ginger</li>
        <li>1 shallot</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp of toasted white sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp roasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>¼ lb ground pork</li>
        <li>1 tsp doubanjiang</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp miso</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
        <li>4 cups Chicken Stock/Broth</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ tsp white pepper powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mince the garlic and ginger.</li>
        <li>Mince the shallot. Set these three prepared ingredients aside.</li>
        <li>Grind the sesame seeds, leaving some seeds unground for texture.</li>
        <li>In a medium pot, heat the sesame oil over medium-low heat and add the minced
            garlic, ginger, and shallot.</li>
        <li>With a wooden spatula, stir fry until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the meat and increase heat to medium. Cook the meat until no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add the spicy bean paste (la doubanjiang) or non-spicy bean paste (doubanjiang)
            and miso. Quickly blend well with the meat before they get burnt.</li>
        <li>Add the ground sesame seeds and sugar and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the sake and chicken stock and bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Taste your soup and add salt (if necessary) and white pepper. Each brand of chicken
            stock varies in saltiness, so you will have to taste your soup to decide how much
            salt to add.</li>
        <li>Cover with the lid and keep the ramen soup simmering while you cook the noodles.</li>
    </ol>
